# Xcode-Dynamic-Icon-Generation
Test project to showcase the AppIcon generation during build time.
The script includes configuration, version and build number in a ribbon. 

It tints the ribbon black or red depending if the configuration belongs to `staging_configurations` or `production_configurations`. 

There are three schemes targeting the different configurations (Debug, Beta, Release).
